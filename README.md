# Shopify Store custom checkout 

## Users can choose pay now or pay later options. Pay later is integrated with original UI and sends standard confirmation email with order number and invoice at fulfillment. 

# Pay now/Pay later orders must be viewed as one interactive list ie Google sheets, Shopify Order Dashboard, etc.
# Spreadsheet works with Store API for orders:
- Customer info (Name, phone, email)
- Service Details (Product, Add-ons, Time, ETD)
- Fulfillment Status = (Pending/Received/Delay/Ready/)
- Notes = ('Brief description of order updates)

# Read spreadsheet with conditional scripts that trigger specific emails based on customer segments
